- **Advanced Mode 🛠️:** Allows for [additional configurations](#advance-mode-️) to be made to the SolidWorks registry, such as enabling Dark Mode, FPS Viewer, and more.
- **Supports Old & New Methods 🕰️:** Works with both old and new methods as needed.
- **FULL USER CONTROL 🖐️:** This tool **DOES NOT apply any changes** directly. It simply generates a `.reg` file for you that you can read and decide to run or not.

## Operation Modes ⚙️

- **Smart 🤖:** Automatically detects and generates all keys.
- **Manual 📝:** Allows generating the files by requesting the missing information from the user when all required data cannot be obtained.

## Usage 📋

0. 🧑 MANUAL - [Download the latest version from Releases (exe or 7z) 📥](https://github.com/ianalexis/Real-View-On-Releases/releases).
1. 🤖 AUTO - The tool detects the installed versions of SolidWorks 🔍.
2. 📑 MANUAL - Select the SolidWorks version.
3. 🤖 AUTO - Search for the GPU used by that version of SolidWorks 🖥️.
   1. 🚧 In case no Renderer is found, the user will be prompted to select:
      1. 🔍 Renderers found in the registry.
      2. 🖥️ Display Adapters found in the Device Manager.
      3. ✍️ Manually enter the GPU model.
         1. 📝 Go to the Device Manager and search for the GPU under Display Adapters.
         2. 💻 Open the GPU properties and copy the name of the device under the Details tab.
         3. ⌨️ Enter the device name into the program and press Enter.
4. 🧑 OPTIONAL - Advance Mode.
   1. 🤖 AUTO - A backup file is generated.
   2. 📑 MANUAL - Select the desired options.
5. 🤖 AUTO - A custom `RealViewOn[SWVersion].reg` file will be generated📝.
6. ✨ MANUAL - Execution of the `.reg` file.
   1. 🕵️ OPTIONAL - Review (with any text editor) the `.reg` file.
   2. 🚀 MANUAL - Execute the `.reg` file by double clicking on it.

## Advance Mode 🛠️

Advanced mode includes a set of additional configurations that can be executed from the same `.reg` file.
Its main use is to avoid the SolidWorks Setting Wizard, which often retains unnecessary data and generates numerous conflicts.
This mode generates a complete backup of the SolidWorks registry with the name `RVO_Wbackup_YY-MM-DD_HH-MM.reg`.

- 🔄 **Reverse Mouse Wheel:** Reverses the mouse wheel direction.
- 🌑 **DarkMode:** Enables Dark Mode.
- 🎮 **FPS Viewer:** Shows the Frames Per Second in the 3D space.
- 🚀 **Performance Enhance graphics:** Enables the Performance Enhance graphics option and Hardware accelerated silhouette edges.
- 🖌️ **Full AntiAliasing:** Enables Full AntiAliasing instead of edges/sketches only.
- 📏 **Spin Box Increment:** Changes the mm steps from 10mm to 1mm.
- ⚙️ **QoL Commands:** Adds Quality of Life commands and tabs like
  - Toolbar:
    - "Normal To"
  - Direct Editing:
    - "Scale"
    - "Flex"
    - "Deform"
  - Tabs:
    - Surfaces
    - Weldments
    - etc.
