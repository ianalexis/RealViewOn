**RealViewOn** enables RealView in SolidWorks versions after 2010 and fixes errors in "Enhanced graphics performance".
This tool can run directly on the target PC (recomended) or manually generate the necessary file to enable RealView on another PC.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Simplifies RealView Activation 🛠️:** Creates a `.reg` file to enable RealView in a straightforward way without needing to browse regedit.
- **FULL USER CONTROL 🖐️:** This tool **DOES NOT apply any changes** directly. It simply generates a `.reg` file for you that you can read and decide to run or not.
- **Supports Old & New Methods 🕰️:** Works with both old and new methods as needed.
- **Fixes Visual & Graphics Issues 🖼️:** Resolves many common graphical errors and visual glitches users experience when enabling enhanced graphics performance.

## Operation Modes ⚙️

- **Smart 🤖:** Automatically detects and generates all keys.
- **Manual 📝:** Allows generating the files by requesting the missing information from the user when all required data cannot be obtained.
